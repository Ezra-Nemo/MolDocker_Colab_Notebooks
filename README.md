# MolDocker

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for cloud-based molecular docking on Google Colab.

## Description

This is a part of [MolDocker](https://github.com/Ezra-Nemo/).

## Getting Started

### Running Notebooks

Just execute the cells in the coorect order, from top to down. The final cell will create a hyperlink that users can click to open the Gradio website in a new tab.
> [!NOTE]
> For notebooks that require conda installation, executing the first cell will restart the entire kernel. This is expected, and users can then execute the following cells to install other dependencies and start the Gradio interface.
